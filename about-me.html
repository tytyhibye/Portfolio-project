        <p>Hello, my name is Tyler and I'm looking to become a software programmer. I moved here from Seattle a few months ago with my wife and am very much looking forward to what Portland has to offer. I've always been the adventurous type (<em>See image</em>) and am always up for a challenge which is why I think this programming course is a perfect fit for me. Developmental technology has always fascinated me and I'm thrilled to see what opportunites this industry holds and the impact it can help me have on others' lives.</p>
